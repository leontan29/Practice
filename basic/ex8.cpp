## Exercise 8: Pointer to a Class Method

**Objective:** Call a class method using a pointer to the object.

**Instructions:**
1. Define a class named `Rectangle` with the following private members:
   - `int width`
   - `int height`
2. Include public methods to:
   - Set the dimensions (`void setDimensions(int w, int h)`).
   - Calculate and return the area (`int getArea()`).
3. In the `main()` function:
   - Create a pointer to a `Rectangle` object.
   - Dynamically allocate memory for the `Rectangle` object.
   - Use the pointer to set the dimensions.
   - Call the method to calculate and print the area.
   - Free the allocated memory after use.

**Sample Output:**
```
Area: 50
```
