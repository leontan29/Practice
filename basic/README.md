### Exercise 1: **Creating a Simple `Rectangle` Class**
- **Objective**: Create a class `Rectangle` that represents a rectangle with a width and height.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define the class with two private data members: `width` and `height`.
  2. Add a constructor that takes two parameters to initialize the width and height.
  3. Write a member function `area()` that returns the area of the rectangle.
  4. Write a member function `perimeter()` that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
  5. Write a main function that creates a `Rectangle` object, sets its dimensions, and prints its area and perimeter.

### Exercise 2: **Creating a `BankAccount` Class**
- **Objective**: Create a class `BankAccount` to manage a bank account with basic operations.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define the class with a private data member `balance` (a double).
  2. Add a constructor that initializes the balance to a specific amount.
  3. Write member functions `deposit(double amount)` and `withdraw(double amount)` to modify the balance.
  4. Write a member function `getBalance()` that returns the current balance.
  5. Write a main function to create a `BankAccount` object, perform some deposits and withdrawals, and print the final balance.

### Exercise 3: **Creating a `Student` Class**
- **Objective**: Create a class `Student` to store information about a student.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define the class with private data members for `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
  2. Add a constructor to initialize these members.
  3. Write member functions `getName()`, `getAge()`, and `getGrade()` to return the respective values.
  4. Write a member function `setGrade(char newGrade)` to update the student's grade.
  5. Write a main function to create a `Student` object, update the grade, and print the student’s information.

### Exercise 4: **Creating a `Circle` Class**
- **Objective**: Create a class `Circle` that represents a circle with a radius.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define the class with a private data member `radius`.
  2. Add a constructor to initialize the radius.
  3. Write a member function `area()` that calculates and returns the area of the circle (use `M_PI` for the value of π).
  4. Write a member function `circumference()` that calculates and returns the circumference.
  5. Write a main function to create a `Circle` object and print its area and circumference.

### Exercise 5: **Creating a `Book` Class**
- **Objective**: Create a class `Book` to represent a book with a title, author, and number of pages.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define the class with private data members for `title`, `author`, and `pages`.
  2. Add a constructor to initialize these members.
  3. Write a member function `getDetails()` that returns a string containing the book's title, author, and the number of pages.
  4. Write a main function to create a `Book` object and print the details of the book.
