## Exercise 7: Array of Objects Using Pointers

**Objective:** Manage an array of objects using pointers.

**Instructions:**
1. Define a class named `Student` with the following private members:
   - `std::string name`
   - `int age`
2. Include public methods to:
   - Set the student details (`void setDetails(std::string n, int a)`).
   - Print the student details (`void printDetails()`).
3. In the `main()` function:
   - Dynamically allocate an array of 3 `Student` objects using a pointer.
   - Use a loop to set and print the details of each student.
   - Free the allocated memory after use.

**Sample Output:**
```
Student 1:
Name: Alice
Age: 19

Student 2:
Name: Bob
Age: 20

Student 3:
Name: Charlie
Age: 18
```
